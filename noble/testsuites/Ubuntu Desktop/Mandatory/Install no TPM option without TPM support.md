<p><em>Proceed in your native language if you wish. Instructions will remain in English.</em></p>
<dl>

<dt>In this test case, make sure that the machine you're installing on does not have the HW requirements for TPM FDE.</dt>

<dt>Boot up the image</dt>
  <dd>If you see the GRUB boot menu you should see the following:</dd>
  <dd>
     <ul>
     <li>'Try or Install FAMILY'</li>
     <li>'FAMILY (safe graphics)'</li>
     <li>'OEM install (for manufacturers)'</li>
     <li>'Test memory' (only on BIOS systems)</li>
     </ul>
  </dd>


<dt>Upon reaching the desktop environment, you should be greeted with the "Choose your language" screen.</dt>
  <dd>Pick your desired language.</dd>


<dt>You should be greeted with a panel where you are prompted to set any of your needed or desired accessibility options.</dt>
  <dd>Click through the options, (Seeing, Hearing, Typing, Pointing and clicking, Zoom) and make sure the drop down options are fully functional.</dd>


<dt>You're greeted with the 'Try or install FAMILY' slide. The 'FAMILY' logo should be on the left hand side.</dt>
  <dd>Select "Install Ubuntu" to continue with the installation process, or "Try Ubuntu" to boot into a live session.</dd>


<dt>You should be greeted with a slide asking you to confirm your keyboard layout.</dt>
  <dd>Feel free to either select your desired layout, or use the auto-detect feature at the bottom.</dd>
<dt>Proceed by clicking "Next"</dt>


<dt>The 'Connect to a network' screen should now be displayed</dt>
<dd>The screen should reflect the current status and display the following options (unless you're in a VM):</dd>
  <dd>
     <ul>
     <li>Wired connection</li>
     <li>Connect to a Wi-Fi network followed by a scrollable list of available APs, displaying an active one colored with a leading checkmark</li>
     <li>Connect to a hidden Wi-Fi network</li>
     <li>I don't want to connect to internet for now</li>
     </ul>
  </dd>
<dd>If you ARE installing in a VM, you should check that the VM automatically has internet access. This is usually via a "wired connection".</dd>
<dd>If you're testing a testcase that requires no internet access, make sure the install medium does not have internet access by configuring it properly in this slide.</dd>
<dt>Click "Next"</dt>


<dt>The 'Applications and updates' screen is displayed, listing normal and minimal installation, as well as options for installing updates, third party software and additional media formats.</dt>
<dd>Select any options pertinent to the testcase - though "Default installation" is normally the desired option.</dd>
<dt>Click "Next"</dt>


  <dd>The 'Installation type' screen is displayed</dd>


<dt>For this check, please use a system with no TPM enabled hardware</dt>

<dt>That's it. If the checkbox isn't available, this testcase has passed.</dt>
